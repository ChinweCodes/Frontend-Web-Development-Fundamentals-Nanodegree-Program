Customize the Card Content
Before you add the styling, you'll first want to customize the starter page with your own content about an animal of your choosing.

For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted.

Link the Style Sheet and Add Class Attributes
For this project, the goal is to fully separate all of the style information from the HTML. In other words, we do not want to put any CSS in the HTML file—instead, all of the CSS will go in styles.css.

To set that up, you'll need to first add a few things to the HTML in card.html
- Use  a link element to link your stylesheet.(if you miss this step, nothing in style.css will have any effect on your page)

- Add class attributes to the HTML elements that you want to style. (Remember, these attributes will allow you to use CSS selectors to style those elements).

- Make sure you use meaningful names for your classes (e.g., don't call them things like class1, class2, etc.)

Add Your CSS
Now it is time to add the CSS that will provide the style seen in the design prototype.

Here are some pointers:

- The image should have a width of 300px. If the image itself isn't 300px, you'll need to set this in your CSS.

- The card's width should be fixed (it should not expand when the workspace or browser window is resized).
- Since the image is 300px wide, the entire card's width should be 300px + spacing on either side.
- The text for the animal's interesting fact is in italics.

- The labels for each of the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat') should be in bold.

- Notice in the prototype that there are no dots (bullet points) for the list items.

- There should be borders around the animal name, image, and text information. Make sure you set the border-style, border-width and border-color. (You can even do it in one line.)

- There should be spacing (padding) around the animal's name, image, the list of items, and the  information.

Check Your Work
Before you submit your project, it's a good idea to check to make sure you have everything you need.

Here are a few last items that are commonly missed that you should check:

- Your submission should include three files: card.html, styles.css, and the image of your animal.

- Make sure all your CSS is in a linked stylesheet (styles.css). Do not include any <style> elements or style attributes directly in card.html!

- Make sure your HTML and CSS is formatted and readable. This includes using newlines and indentation to make the structure of your markup clear to your reviewer.

- If you've completed all the steps above, you should be in good shape! But if you like, you can also have a look over the project rubric here, which lists exactly what we'll check when we look over your work.

Standout Suggestions (Optional)
To take your submission to the next level, you can add additional customizations to your card. As long as you include all of the above, you're welcome (and encouraged) to play with the styles and adjust the design.

For inspiration, here are some ideas:

Change the background colors or border-radius.
Add a box shadow on the entire card.
If you really want to challenge yourself, you could try creating multiple cards that are all displayed on the same page—and you could even use flexbox to adjust how they get displayed when the page is resized.

- Add any standout customizations that you like to your card.
