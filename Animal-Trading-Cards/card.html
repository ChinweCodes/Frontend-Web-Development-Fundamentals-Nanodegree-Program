			<p> The newts consume aquatic insects, such as mosquitos. This is beneficial to humans, because eastern newts 
                may help to control insect populations.Eastern newts' skin is slightly toxic, which helps protect it from predators.

			<p> The eastern newt is a common newt of Eastern North America. It frequents small lakes, ponds, and streams or
                nearby wet forests. It produces tetrodotoxin, which makes the species unpalatable to predatory 
                fish and crayfish. It has a lifespan of 12 to 15 years in the wild, and it may grow to 5 inches in length. Salamandrids 
                are also known as the "newts," a term which often breeds some confusion as in "What is the difference between 
                a salamander and a newt?" The answer is nothing. A newt is simply a specific type of salamander, namely members of 
                the family Salamandridae. In other words, all newts are salamanders, but not all salamanders are newts. The newts have an 
                extremely wide distribution, as they are found in North America, Europe, Asia, and even portions of northern Africa. They are 
                known for a diversity of shapes and colors, especially among the males of the European species during the breeding season. 
                In North America, however, there are only two genera, and only one of them, Notophthalmus, is found east of the Mississippi River. 
                Eastern newts start out as larvae. At birth, they hatch from their eggs in calm, fresh water. This is also where they will 
                spend most of their time as adults. But during adolescence, between the ages of 3 and 4 weeks old, many of these newt larvae 
                turn into "red efts." It's a temporary phase â€” marked by physical changes that influence behavior.
