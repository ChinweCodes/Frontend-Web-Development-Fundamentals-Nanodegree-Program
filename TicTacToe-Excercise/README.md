In this last part of the lesson, we're presenting you with a challenge very similar to what a real web developer might encounter:
 You'll be given a design and asked to apply your new CSS skills to reproduce it.
 In the workspace below, try replicating the design of the tic-tac-toe board shown in the video. There's also a copy of the image below the workspace.

To do this, you'll only need to add CSS rules to the file tictactoe.css. (You don't need to edit the HTML file at all!)

Here are a few hints:

- The ul and the li elements have boxes just like the div elements we've been working with. And you can think about the ul as a container for the li elements.
- You will probably run into a couple of places where you need to look up CSS properties you haven't encountered before. For example, you'll need some way of hiding    the bullets in the bulleted list. Google is your friend here!
