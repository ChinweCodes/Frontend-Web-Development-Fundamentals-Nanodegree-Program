/**
 * Directions:
    Create an object called facebookProfile. The object should have 3 properties:

    your name
    the number of friends you have, and
    an array of messages you've posted (as strings)
    The object should also have 4 methods:

    postMessage(message) - adds a new message string to the array
    deleteMessage(index) - removes the message corresponding to the index provided
    addFriend() - increases the friend count by 1
    removeFriend() - decreases the friend count by 1
 */

    /*
 * Programming Quiz: Facebook Friends (7-5)
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have an object `facebookProfile`
 * - The `facebookProfile` object should have the `name` (string), `friends` (number), and `messages` (array of strings) property
 * - Your `facebookProfile` object should have the `postMessage()`, `deleteMessage()`, `addFriend()` and `removeFriend()` method
 * - Carefully implement the desired functionality of each method, as decribed above
 */


// TIP - 
// In an array, 
// - addition at the end is done using push() method
// - addition at a specific index is done using splice() method
// - deletion from the beginning is done using pop() method
// - deletion from a specific index is done using splice() method

// your code goes here
var facebookProfile= {
    name: "Chinwe",
    friends: 1000,
    messages:["Hi, Chinwe.", "How are you doing ","What are you doing for fun?"],
    postMessage: function(message){
        facebookProfile.messages.push(message);
    },
    deleteMessage: function(index){
        // In the following splice() method call,
        // - argument 1 = index from where the element has to be deleted
        // - argument 2 = count of elements to be deleted
        facebookProfile.messages.splice(index, 1);
    },
    addFriend: function(){
        facebookProfile.friends = facebookProfile.friends + 1;
    },
    removeFriend: function(){
        if(facebookProfile.friends>0)
            facebookProfile.friends = facebookProfile.friends - 1;
    }
};
