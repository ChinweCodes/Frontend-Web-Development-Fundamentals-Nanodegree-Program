                <h3> Bantu knots</h3>

                    <p id="Brief-History">Bantu knots are a traditional African hairstyle that has been around for over 100 years.
                    "Bantu" is a comprehensive term used to describe the 300 to 600 ethnic groups within southern Africa that spoke 
                    the Bantu language, according to the South Africa His flex-direction: row;tory Organization (SAHO). However, it is important to mention
                    that Bantu speaking people are not a homogeneous group. In fact, SAHO discloses that there are over 100 million people
                    speaking variations of the Bantu language in southern and central Africa who speak about 700 languages, including several dialects. 
                    Interestingly though, across these regions "Abantu" (or Bantu as used by colonists) is recognized as the Zulu word for people in most 
                    languages."It is the plural of the word 'umuntu', meaning 'person', and is based on the stem '--ntu' plus the plural prefix 'aba'."(naturallycurly.com)</p>

                    <p>The Zulu people of southern Africa originated Bantu knots, 
                    a hairstyle where the hair is sectioned off, twisted, and wrapped in a such a
                    way that the hair stacks upon itself to form a spiraled knot(byrdie.com). </p>
